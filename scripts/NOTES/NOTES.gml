//using a state machine for animation and sound placeholders
//potential gameplay features:
	//switches/levers
	//moving platforms
	//movable objects 
	//baisc enemy
	//ladder climbing(?)
		//might be animation expensive


//Simplest Idea I had. Side scrolling puzzle platformer 
//with pickups that make you bigger or smaller. 
//When bigger: You can move larger things, jump higher, break light things. 
//When smaller: you can move faster, fit through smaller areas.


//idea: "A small guy climbing a big mountain"
//art: "the proprotions of objects that are usually small are big, and vice versa"
