-- using a state machine for animation and sound placeholders --

simple idea: side scrolling puzzle platformer, 
with pickups that make you bigger or smaller. 
- when bigger, you can move larger things, jump higher, break light things. 
- when smaller, you can move faster, fit through smaller areas.
	- would these powerups be on a timer?
	
concept: "A small guy climbing big mountains."
art: "Objects that are usually small are big, and vice versa."
music: ~2-3 tracks
	- a title/menu theme
	- the overworld/level theme
	- a fanfare/success theme
		-*AiaiPanda can provide a draft
	- a failiure theme(?)
		- only if we have time
sfx: get them for free 

potential gameplay features:
	- switches/levers
	- moving platforms
	- movable objects 
	- basic enemy(s)(?)
		- one that acts like a goomba: 
			- if you collide with it while big, it gets defeated
			- else, you get knockbacked / die
		- one that shoots horizontal projectiles and stays still(?)
		- might be animation expensive
	- ladders(?)
		- might be animation expensive
		
level design: "Very vertical."
	- lets make the player feel like they are climbing a mountain.
