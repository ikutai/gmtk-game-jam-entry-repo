/*

using a state machine for animation and sound placeholders
potential gameplay features:
	- switches/levers
	- moving platforms
	- movable objects 
	- baisc enemy(s)
	- ladders(?)
		//might be animation expensive


simple idea: side scrolling puzzle platformer, 
with pickups that make you bigger or smaller. 
- When bigger, you can move larger things, jump higher, break light things. 
- When smaller, you can move faster, fit through smaller areas.
	- Would these powerups be on a timer?


concept: "A small guy climbing big mountains."
art: "The proprotions of objects that are usually small are big, and vice versa."
